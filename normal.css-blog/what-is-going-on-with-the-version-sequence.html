<h2 id="semantic-versioning-talk">Semantic versioning talk</h2>
<p><a href="https://semver.org/">https://semver.org/</a> says <strong>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</strong> as semantic versioning,
    while this one is MAJOR.MINOR-OR-PATCH. This is standard to only <strong>most</strong> software, and as a developer
    of a project, you decide everything you put in, including source code releases, version sequences, and everything.
</p>
<h2 id="and-what-about-page-productname-">And what about Normal.css?</h2>
<p>Well, we turn to customizing. We crafted the version sequence MAJOR.MINOR-OR-PATCH in an effort to separation. As
    mentioned earlier, customization is a priority to software that wants to spread out from the most-used things. And,
    we decided to go this way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-and-answer">Conclusion and answer</h2>
<p>We decided to go much quickly to 1.0, just so that we could simply enter the market of stable quick.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-sharing-that-to-public-">But what about sharing that to public?</h3>
<p>Yes, we call this Fast-to-1 versioning (not trademarked). However it is not software, so we&#39;re not making a repo
    (lol).</p>
